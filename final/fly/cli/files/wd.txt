Wi-Fi CERTIFIED Wi-Fi Direct® is a certification mark for devices supporting a technology that enables Wi-Fi devices to connect directly, making it simple and convenient to do things like print, share, sync and display. Products bearing the Wi-Fi Direct certification mark can connect to one another without joining a traditional home, office or hotspot network.

Mobile phones, cameras, printers, PCs, and gaming devices connect to each other directly to transfer content and share applications quickly and easily. Devices can make a one-to-one connection, or a group of several devices can connect simultaneously. Connecting Wi-Fi Direct-certified devices is easy and simple, with the push of a button, tapping two NFC-capable devices together, or entering a PIN. Moreover, all Wi-Fi Direct connections are protected by WPA2™, the latest Wi-Fi security technology. With Wi-Fi Direct, you do not need an access point or internet connection – your personal Wi-Fi network goes with you wherever you go.

A set of optional pre-defined services let devices send files, print documents, play media and display screens between and among devices easily, no matter the vendor. The standard enhanced services let users “discover, connect and do” in a single step to perform these common tasks. The new service platform also fosters innovative development opportunities for new applications to take advantage of direct device-to-device connections.ections.
